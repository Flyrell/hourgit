## Acceptance

In order to get any license under these terms, you must agree to them as both
strict obligations and conditions to all your licenses.

## Copyright License

The licensor grants you a copyright license for the software to do everything
you might do with the software that would otherwise infringe the licensor's
copyright in it for any permitted purpose under these terms, other than
distributing the software or making changes or new works based on the software.

## Distribution License

The licensor grants you an additional copyright license to distribute copies of
the software. Your license to distribute covers distributing the software with
changes and new works permitted by [Changes and New Works License](#changes-and-new-works-license).

## Notices

You must ensure that anyone who gets a copy of any part of the software from
you also gets a copy of these terms or the URL for them above, as well as
copies of any plain-text lines beginning with `Required Notice:` that the
licensor provided with the software. For example:

> Required Notice: Copyright Dawid Zbiński (https://github.com/Flyrell/hour-git)

## Changes and New Works License

The licensor grants you an additional copyright license to make changes and new
works based on the software for any permitted purpose.

## Patent License

The licensor grants you a patent license for the software that covers patent
claims the licensor can license, or becomes able to license, that you would
infringe by using the software.

## Noncompete

Any purpose is a permitted purpose, except for providing any product that
competes with the software or any product the licensor or any of its affiliates
provides using the software.

## Competition

Goods and services compete even when they provide functionality through
different kinds of interfaces or for different technical platforms. Applications
can compete with developer tools and libraries, and vice versa. Goods and
services compete even if they are provided free of charge, and even if marketed
as practical substitutes for one another.

## New Products

If you are using the software to provide a product that does not compete, you
may continue to do so after the licensor or any of its affiliates begins
providing a competing product, but only with versions of the software available
before the competing product was first provided.

## Discontinued Products

You may begin using the software to provide a product that competes with one
the licensor or any of its affiliates has stopped providing, unless the
licensor includes a `Licensor Line of Business:` line in the terms of a
particular version of the software to say otherwise.

## Sales of Business

If the licensor or any of its affiliates sells a line of business providing a
competing product, the buyer can enforce the noncompete for that product as if
they were the licensor.

## Fair Use

You may have "fair use" rights for the software under the law. These terms do
not limit them.

## No Other Rights

These terms do not allow you to sublicense or transfer any of your licenses to
anyone else, or prevent the licensor from granting licenses to anyone else.
These terms do not imply any other licenses.

## Patent Defense

If you make any written claim that the software infringes or contributes to
infringement of any patent, your patent license for the software granted under
these terms ends immediately. If your company makes such a claim, your patent
license ends immediately for work on behalf of your company.

## Violations

The first time you are notified in writing that you have violated any of these
terms, or done anything with the software not covered by your licenses, your
licenses can nonetheless continue if you come into full compliance with these
terms, and take practical steps to correct past violations, within 32 days of
receiving notice. Otherwise, all your licenses end immediately.

## No Liability

***As far as the law allows, the software comes as is, without any warranty or
condition, and the licensor will not be liable to you for any damages arising
out of these terms or the use or nature of the software, under any kind of
legal claim.***
